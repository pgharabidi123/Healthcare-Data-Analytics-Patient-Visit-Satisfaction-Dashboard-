# Problem Statement

City General Hospital is one of the leading healthcare providers. Over the years, they have been facing challenges in managing emergency room operations effectively. Increasing patient load, long wait times, and uneven resource allocation have negatively impacted patient satisfaction.

To address this, the hospital management decided to leverage Business & Data Intelligence. However, they lack an internal analytics team, so they hired a data intelligence provider to analyze emergency room visit data and provide actionable insights to improve operations, resource allocation, and patient experience.
